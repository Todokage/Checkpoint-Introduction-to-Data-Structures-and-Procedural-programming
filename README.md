Check each element in Set 1 ([3, 1, 7, 9]):
3 is in Set 2, so skip it.
1 is in Set 2, so skip it.
7 is not in Set 2, so add 7 to the sum. sum = 7.
9 is in Set 2, so skip it.
Check each element in Set 2 ([2, 4, 1, 9, 3]):
2 is not in Set 1, so add 2 to the sum. sum = 7 + 2 = 9.
4 is not in Set 1, so add 4 to the sum. sum = 9 + 4 = 13.
1 is in Set 1, so skip it.
9 is in Set 1, so skip it.
3 is in Set 1, so skip it.

Final result: sum = 13

For the first pair: Dot product is 
3×2+1×4+7×1=6+4+7=17. These vectors are not orthogonal.
For the second pair: Dot product is 
1×3+2×0+3×−1=3+0−3=0. These vectors are orthogonal.
For the third pair: Dot product is 
4×4+5×3+6×2=16+15+12=43. These vectors are not orthogonal.

Final Output:
Vectors 0 are not orthogonal.
Vectors 1 are orthogonal.
Vectors 2 are not orthogonal.
